2009 MBTA on-board passenger survey results apps

These apps were written by Mary McShane circa 2010. 

This repo contains the code for 4 apps, each of which is has its own HTML "index" file:
* rtSurveyApp.html - rapid transit survey results app
* crSurvyApp.html - commuter rail survey results app
* busSurveyApp.html - key bus routes survey results app
* boatSurveyApp.html - commuter ferry/boad survey results app

These apps were modified by Ben Krepp in 2018 to use a PostGIS/PostgreSQL data source rather than an ArcSDE/Oracle data source, but are otherwise unchanged.
